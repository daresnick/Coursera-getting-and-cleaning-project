### Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

**Introduction:**   
This repository is for the final project of the Coursera, Johns Hopkins, Getting and Cleaning Data course. It serves to demonstrate the getting and cleaning of data into a tidy form that can be better used for analysis. The data used in this project is from the: [ UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)  
[Data found here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

**Project Includes R script run_analysis.R that follows these instructions:**  
1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set  
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  

**Input:**   
The data and data folders were previously loaded to the working directory for the run_analysis.R script.

**Output:**   
The final output of the script is a tidy data set tidydata.txt.
