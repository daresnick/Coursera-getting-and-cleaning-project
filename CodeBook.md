##**Introduction:**   
The script `run_analysis.R` does the cleaning and merging of the data per these instructions:  
1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
### cbind() and rbind(0 are used to combine the data files  
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
###  grepl() is used to find the mean and sd columns  
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set  
###  merge() is used  
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  
###  columns are simply renamed  
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  
###  melt and dcast are used to summarize the means for each set  

- The data and data folders were previously loaded to the working directory for the run_analysis.R script.  

- The final output of the script is a tidy data set tidydata.txt.  

- The script `run_analysis.R` is well commented to explain each step and the code used.  

##**Variables and Data:**   
- activityLabels and features contain the types of activities and variable names 
- xTrain, yTrain, subjectTrain, xTest, yTest, subjectTest contain the downloaded data
- trainData and testData combine the two sets of data in allData
- finalData2 includes the merged data along with the activity labels
- finalData3mean dcasts the melted data from finalData3melt which is turned into `tidydata.txt`
