##**Introduction:**   
The script run_analysis.R does the cleaning and merging of the data per these instructions:  
1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set  
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  
    
- The data and data folders were previously loaded to the working directory for the run_analysis.R script.  

- The final output of the script is a tidy data set tidydata.txt.  

- The script run_analysis.R is well commented to explain each step and the code used.  

##**Variables and Data:**   
- activityLabels and features contain the types of activities and variable names
